## Read this before continuing to the source code.

The project is missing some folders and files (due to transmission issues), if you want to see everything please contact me by leaving a ticket via my web site: [https://asichakib.github.io/AbdelmounaimSalouani/].  
Otherwise, I will put, later, the instruction to generate the other components, they are all AI related files (like weights, test video set, intermediate tests...).
happy hacking!
